And my cup is full, and my luck is in
And my face is set in a stupid grin
And it's happy hour and the world is smiling
Every thunder cloud has a silver lining

Bad day you're having
No way you'll let me be
Cos it's the good life I'm living
Hard time you're giving me

And I'm right on time, yeah I'm right on track
And I love my life and it loves me back
And a view unfolds I can feast my eyes
There's a pot of gold over the horizon

Bad day you're having
No way you'll let me be
Cos it's the good life I'm living
Hard time you're giving me
And I love my life

I want you to be happy, I want you to be
I want you to be happy, I want you to be
I want you to be happy, I want you to be

But if you'd like to see me fail
If you'd like to see me fall
If my loss is your gain
If my joy is your pain
Bad day you're having

Bad day you're having
Bad day you're having
No way you'll let me be
Cos it's the good life I'm living
Hard time you're giving me
And I love my life and it loves me back
